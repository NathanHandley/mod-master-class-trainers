# Master Class Trainers

## Description

With this mod, hitting a level target (default 80) on a class allows you to learn both spells and talents from trainers of that class on alts which are of a different class.  For example: If set to level 80, a level 1 paladin could learn rogue abilities from a rogue trainer if that player has a level 80 rogue on the server.

There are two tiers of master trainers, each configurable for a different triggering level:
- Master Trainer: Allows the learning of abilities/talents at their level appropriate time
- Grand Master Trainer: Allows the learning of all abilities/talents at level 1.

This addon does take into account the talent gain rate of the server.  i.e.: A talent gain rate of 2x would enable talents available at an earlier level vs a 1x talent gain rate.
